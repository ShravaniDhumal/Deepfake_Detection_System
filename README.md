## Models README

# Models Directory

This directory stores trained model weights that can be shared across different devices.

## Purpose

- **Avoid Retraining**: Once trained, copy the model file to other devices
- **Consistency**: Use the same trained model across all devices
- **Version Control**: Keep different model versions for comparison

## Model File

After training, the model will be saved as:
```
models/xception_deepfake.pth
```

## Sharing Models Across Devices

### Method 1: Direct Copy
```bash
# On training device
cp models/xception_deepfake.pth /path/to/shared/location

# On other device
cp /path/to/shared/location/xception_deepfake.pth models/
```

### Method 2: Git (for small models)
```bash
# Add model to git (if repository is set up)
git add models/xception_deepfake.pth
git commit -m "Add trained model"
git push

# On other device
git pull
```

### Method 3: Cloud Storage
Upload to Google Drive, Dropbox, etc., and download on other devices.

## Model Information

- **Architecture**: MobileNetV2 (Xception-based)
- **Input Size**: 224x224 RGB images
- **Output**: Binary classification (Real/Fake)
- **Format**: PyTorch state dict (.pth)

## Usage

The backend automatically looks for models in this directory. No configuration needed - just place the model file here and restart the backend server.

## Important Notes

- **File Size**: Model files can be large (50-200MB typically)
- **Compatibility**: Models trained on one device work on all devices (CPU/GPU)
- **Version**: Ensure PyTorch versions are compatible across devices

## Backend README

# Backend - Deepfake Detection API

This directory contains the backend server and training scripts for the Deepfake Detection System.

## Structure

```
backend/
├── app.py                 # Flask API server
├── pytorch/               # Training scripts and model definitions
│   ├── train_improved.py # Main training script
│   ├── dataset_improved.py
│   ├── config.yaml       # Training configuration
│   └── models/           # Model architecture definitions
├── tensorflow/           # TensorFlow inference (if needed)
└── uploads/              # Temporary upload directory
```

## Running the Backend Server

```bash
# From project root
cd backend
python app.py
```

The server will start on `http://localhost:3000`

## Training a Model

### Option 1: Using Hugging Face Dataset (Recommended)

1. Edit `pytorch/config.yaml`:
   ```yaml
   data:
     use_huggingface_dataset: true
     huggingface_dataset: "prithivMLmods/OpenDeepfake-Preview"
   ```

2. Run training:
   ```bash
   cd backend/pytorch
   python train_improved.py
   ```

### Option 2: Using Local Dataset

1. Prepare your dataset:
   ```
   data/processed/
   ├── train/
   │   ├── real/
   │   └── fake/
   └── val/
       ├── real/
       └── fake/
   ```

2. Edit `pytorch/config.yaml`:
   ```yaml
   data:
     use_huggingface_dataset: false
     train_dir: ../../data/processed/train
     val_dir: ../../data/processed/val
   ```

3. Run training:
   ```bash
   cd backend/pytorch
   python train_improved.py
   ```

## Model Storage

Trained models are saved to the `models/` directory at the project root. This allows you to:

- **Share models across devices**: Copy the model file to other machines
- **Avoid retraining**: Use the same trained model on different devices
- **Version control**: Keep different model versions

The model will be saved as `models/xception_deepfake.pth` after training completes.

## API Endpoints

- `GET /` - Serve frontend
- `POST /api/upload` - Upload and analyze an image
- `POST /api/webcam/start` - Start webcam capture
- `GET /api/webcam/frame` - Get latest webcam frame with detections
- `POST /api/webcam/stop` - Stop webcam capture
- `GET /api/history` - Get analysis history
- `GET /api/stats` - Get statistics

## Troubleshooting

### Model Not Found Error

If you see "Model not available" errors:
1. Train a model first using `train_improved.py`
2. Ensure the model is saved to `models/xception_deepfake.pth`
3. Check that the model file exists and is readable

### Training Issues

If training shows wrong information:
1. Check your dataset - ensure images are properly labeled (real/fake)
2. Verify dataset paths in `config.yaml`
3. Increase training epochs if accuracy is low
4. Check training logs for errors

### Path Issues

All paths in the backend are relative to the backend directory. The training script automatically resolves paths from the config file location.

## Frontend README

## Backend Utils README

# Utility Scripts

This directory contains utility scripts for data processing and project management.

## Scripts

- `extract_frames.py` - Extract frames from video files for training data
- `split_dataset.py` - Split dataset into train/validation sets

## Usage

These are helper scripts for data preparation. The main application uses the backend API and training scripts in the parent directories.

## Test README

# Test Videos

This directory contains test video samples for deepfake detection.

## Structure

```
test/
├── Real/          # Real video samples (not deepfakes)
└── deepfake/      # Deepfake video samples
```

## Usage

These videos can be used for:
- Testing the detection system
- Evaluation and benchmarking
- Demonstration purposes

## Notes

- Videos are in `.mp4` format
- Use utility scripts in `backend/utils/` to extract frames from videos
- These are test samples, not training data

## Data README

# Data Directory

This directory contains training and test datasets for the deepfake detection system.

## Structure

```
data/
├── raw/                    # Raw dataset (original images/videos)
│   ├── real/              # Real face images/videos
│   └── fake/              # Deepfake images/videos
│
└── processed/              # Processed dataset for training
    ├── train/             # Training data
    │   ├── real/          # Real training images
    │   └── fake/          # Fake training images
    │
    └── val/               # Validation data
        ├── real/          # Real validation images
        └── fake/          # Fake validation images
```

## Usage

### For Local Training

1. Place your raw data in `data/raw/real/` and `data/raw/fake/`
2. Process and split data using utility scripts:
   ```bash
   cd backend/utils
   python extract_frames.py  # Extract frames from videos
   python split_dataset.py   # Split into train/val
   ```
3. Processed data will be in `data/processed/train/` and `data/processed/val/`
4. Update `backend/pytorch/config.yaml` to use local data:
   ```yaml
   data:
     use_huggingface_dataset: false
     train_dir: ../../data/processed/train
     val_dir: ../../data/processed/val
   ```

### For Hugging Face Dataset

The system can also use Hugging Face datasets. See `backend/pytorch/config.yaml` for configuration.

## Notes

- Images should be in formats: `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, `.bmp`
- Videos should be in `.mp4` format
- Ensure proper labeling: real images in `real/`, fake images in `fake/`

## Backend Evaluation README

# Model Evaluation

This directory contains scripts for evaluating trained deepfake detection models.

## Scripts
- **generate_predictions.py** - Generate predictions from a trained model
  - Loads a trained PyTorch model
  - Runs inference on labeled data
  - Saves `y_true.npy`, `y_pred.npy`, and `y_proba.npy`
- **metrics.py** - Evaluate saved predictions
  - Confusion matrix + classification report
  - Optional ROC / Precision-Recall curves + JSON export

## Usage

### Generate Predictions
```bash
cd backend/evaluation
python generate_predictions.py \
    --model ../../models/xception_deepfake.pth \
    --data ../../data/processed/val \
    --output .
```
This will create `y_true.npy`, `y_pred.npy`, and `y_proba.npy`.

### Evaluate Model
```bash
cd backend/evaluation
python metrics.py y_true.npy y_pred.npy y_proba.npy
```
This prints metrics and (by default) writes files like `confusion_matrix.png`, `roc_curve.png`, `pr_curve.png`, and `metrics.json`.

## Requirements

- Trained model in `models/xception_deepfake.pth`
- Test data with ground truth labels
- NumPy and scikit-learn installed

## Models ONNX README

# ONNX Models

This directory contains exported ONNX model files for cross-platform deployment.

## Purpose

ONNX (Open Neural Network Exchange) models allow you to:
- Deploy models on different platforms (CPU, GPU, mobile)
- Use different inference engines (ONNX Runtime, TensorRT, etc.)
- Optimize models for production

## Exporting Models

To export a PyTorch model to ONNX format:

```bash
cd backend/pytorch
python export_to_onnx.py
```

The exported model will be saved to `models/onnx/xception_deepfake.onnx`

## Usage

ONNX models can be used with ONNX Runtime:

```python
import onnxruntime as ort

# Load model
session = ort.InferenceSession("models/onnx/xception_deepfake.onnx")

# Run inference
outputs = session.run(None, {"input": preprocessed_image})
```

## Notes

- ONNX models are typically smaller and faster than PyTorch models
- Good for production deployment
- Cross-platform compatible
